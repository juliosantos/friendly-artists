# Friendly Artists  

## About

Friendly Artists is a very basic social music recommendation system. It fetches your Facebook friends and their Open Graph `music.listens` published actions. Upon inspecting the related song objects, it counts artist frequency to determine a recommendation order.

## Context

I created this demo app to support my workshop at Social Media Week Berlin, «Fetching Open Graph Data — A Basic Introduction for Curious Developers». Please note that the app is not to be considered production-ready.

The app is ready for Heroku deployment, requiring only 1 web dyno (and that a Facebook app is created and connected to this).

A live deployment is available at [friendlyartists.herokuapp.com](http://friendlyartists.herokuapp.com)
